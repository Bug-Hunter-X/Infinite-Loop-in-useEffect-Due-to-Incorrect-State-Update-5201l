This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: incorrectly updating state within the effect, causing an infinite loop.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  This infinite loop issue can be tricky to debug as it can manifest as a performance issue or a full application crash depending on the nature of the state update.  Always ensure that state updates are managed correctly in `useEffect` to avoid these issues.
